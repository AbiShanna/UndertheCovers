    "The UNIX operating system was built by master programmers who valued programmablity and productivity.  In some sense learning to work on the UNIX systems is a right of passage that not only teaches you how to be productive on a computer runnig the UNIX operating system but teaching you to think and act like a programmer.\n",

    "## The Shell -- Progammable Interface to the computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Given its history and programmer bent UNIX's primary interface -- or way of interacting with it to get things done is a program called the \"shell\".  In the following sections we will introduce various aspects of the shell, UNIX and fundamental ideas common to all modern operating systems.    \n",

    "\n",
    "To work with a UNIX computer you must establish in one way or anther an plain text interactive session.  To do this you must start a \"Terminal\".  A \"Terminal\" is a Plain Text or \"ASCII\" application that is designed to accept characters from your keyboard and send them to a remote program and similarly chacters sent from the program will be displayed within it.  \n",

    "The next step is to connect\n",
