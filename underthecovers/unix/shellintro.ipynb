The common short hand notation for the newline byte value is `\\n`.  Pressing the *return*  or *enter* key, depending on your keyboard, within a terminal window will generate this value.

The two modes are character and line.  In character mode the terminal data is sent along to the program running as soon as they are received, including the `\\n`.  In line (or buffered mode) the kernel stores up the characters and sent until it receives a `\\n`.   At which point it sends the complete line with the `\\n` to the program running. The default mode is typically line mode.  For the most part it does not really matter to us as the shell's behavior is largely the same as it is a line oriented program that is designed to process whole lines at a time.

Precisely, it sent the binary pattern `0b10000010` or in hex `0xa` as the left most sub-figure (A) illustrates.  The [figure](#fig:shell-blankline) show both the `\\n` human readable ASCII symbol and the underlying byte value.  In other diagrams we might stop showing the byte values and only show the ASCII human readable symbol.  It is, however, important to remember that under the covers the terminal and shell are really just exchanging raw binary values that use the ASCII standard to encode the data.  If we were to use special device, such as a [logic analyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_analyzer), to peek at the electical wires that make up the path ways that are transmitting data back and forth between the computer and the terminal we would find electical values that encode the binary for the characters being exchanged. \n",

You might be wondering why is it that you see the characters you type at the keyboard of terminal appear on the screen of the terminal.  If pressing a key really sends the data to the Unix kernel and then to the program running, such as the shell, there is not reason we would see it.  Does the Shell send a copy back of what it receives?  No it does not.  Rather typically the UNIX kernel is configured, by default, to send back a copy of what it receives on a specific terminal connection back to the terminal itself.  This setting is called terminal ECHO mode.  So by default even before the Kernel sends data up to the destination program it sends a copy back to the terminal so that the user can see what they typed.  This includes the `\\n` that the user pressed to indicate the end of the command line.  Hence, in this default mode any data sent back from the shells behavior will appear on a new-line.  Programs can ask the kernel to disable this setting to have more control of what the users sees.  As a matter of fact like many things in Unix there is a command you can issue to have the kernel adjust the setting for you terminal connect including turning off the echo behavior (`stty -echo` to turn off and `stty echo` to turn back on).  Doing so lets you observe what is really being sent back in response to your command and not what the kernel automatically generated as echo data.  Note things might get confusing quickly if you turn echo off.   But Unix is all about understanding how things work and have the power to control them.  If you want to know more try `man stty` but be warned you will find that communications on a terminal is actually quite a bit more complex than it might seem -- there is a lot of history and skeletons buried here and the kernel is *cooking* the communications quite a bit ;-)"

The rules of this processing define what is called the [Shell Grammar](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html#SHELL_GRAMMAR).  The Shell Grammar and builtin commands form an entire programming language.  Programs written in this language are called Shell Scripts and are used extensively to automate all sorts of tasks.     Over the years one learns more and more subtle aspects and usage of the shell grammar.  While it is possible to use the shell without really knowing its underlying grammer having a working knowledge can really help in understanding why the shell behaves the way it does and its somewhat strange syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this chapter we will build up our working knowledge of how the shell processes command lines and its grammar.  Let's begin by breaking down command line processing into the following six steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. break up (split) the line into \"blank\" seperated words (computer scientists also call these tokens)\n",
    "2. perform expansions\n",
    "3. parse redirections\n",
    "4. execute simple commands\n",
    "5. optionally wait for command to complete\n",
    "6. print prompt and wait for new command line if in interactive mode\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Breaking down a \"Command line\" into Simple Commands and Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step the shell splits the command line up into a set of tokens that form a \"simple commands\".   Several simple commands can make up a single command line. The common boundary that separates tokens are \"blanks\".  Blanks are `space` and `tab` characters ([blanks](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html#DEFINITIONS).   In the ASCII code, space characters are encoded with a byte value of `0x20` and a tab is encoded by `0x09`.  So a sequence of one more of these two characters will cause the shell to split what is before and after the sequence into to separate tokens.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the blank `space` and `tab` characters the following characters `|  & ; ( ) < > newline` will also indicate the speration of tokens.  Together, these characters are known as the shell \"metacharacters\".  In time we will learn about how these characters affect the commands to be executed. Some will let us combine simple commands in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first token of simple command is the name of the command to execute.  The following tokens in a set will be passed to the command as arguments.     To know where the arguments of a particular simple command ends the shell looks for one of the following \"control\" operators.  Notice that some of the metacharacters, `| & ; ( )` and `newline` itself both separate tokens and terminate the tokens of simple command.    Using the control characters allow us to chain independent simple commands together. "

Two spaces then separate `hello` from `goodbye`.  Then tghe sequence of space, tab, space separate `goodbye` from `me`.  A single space seperates `me` from `again`.  `again` is terminated as a token by the following space, tab and newline.

    "- Synopsis: Like  programming languages the shell supports the notion of a variable that is identified by a \"name\" and has a \"value\".  Shell variables are actually a special case of a what are called shell parameters. We will focus on variables. The shell provides certain special built in variables such as \"RANDOM\" whose value expands to a random number. As we will see later a very important built is the \"PATH\" variable.  There are several ways we can introduce our own variables and assign them a value.  The simplest is a command line of the form:  `name=value`.   During Parameter Expansion the `$` followed by name will trigger parameter expansion, optionally the name can be enclosed in braces `{name}`.  The token will then be expanded to the value if the named variable exists other wise the token will be simply removed.  The shell provides all kinds of fancy ways of manipulating and transforming the value of a variable during expansions, such as deleting or substituting portions, but we will leave that for later.  Finally shell variables can have attributes associated with them.   One important attribute marks a variable as exported.  We will see later that exported variables are passed to new programs as part of their initial \"environment\".  \n",

The way you state a pattern and the way it is matched can get quit subtle and complex.  But the basic use is easy and can really save you time.   Ater the preceeding expansions are done and the second round of word splitting is complete the shell will scan what is left looking for a special set of characters its recognizes as pattern characters.  The most useful of these is the star `*`. The star will be substituted for any sequence of characters.  As such it is often called the wildcard character since it matches anything.  The shell will then look to see if there are files or directories that match the token subtituting the patterns as necessary.  If matching names exist then it will replace the single token with any matches found.  While this can sound complicated, in practice, the simple uses are straight forward and easy to understand from examples.  You will really want to play with this.\n",
