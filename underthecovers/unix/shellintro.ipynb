The common short hand notation for the newline byte value is `\\n`.  Pressing the *return*  or *enter* key, depending on your keyboard, within a terminal window will generate this value.

The two modes are character and line.  In character mode the terminal data is sent along to the program running as soon as they are received, including the `\\n`.  In line (or buffered mode) the kernel stores up the characters and sent until it receives a `\\n`.   At which point it sends the complete line with the `\\n` to the program running. The default mode is typically line mode.  For the most part it does not really matter to us as the shell's behavior is largely the same as it is a line oriented program that is designed to process whole lines at a time.

The [figure](#fig:shell-blankline) show both the `\\n` human readable ASCII symbol and the underlying byte value.  In other diagrams we might stop showing the byte values and only show the ASCII human readable symbol.  It is, however, important to remember that under the covers the terminal and shell are really just exchanging raw binary values that use the ASCII standard to encode the data.  If we were to use special device, such as a [logic analyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_analyzer), to peek at the electical wires that make up the path ways that are transmitting data back and forth between the computer and the terminal we would find electical values that encode the binary for the characters being exchanged. \n",

You might be wondering why is it that you see the characters you type at the keyboard of terminal appear on the screen of the terminal.  If pressing a key really sends the data to the Unix kernel and then to the program running, such as the shell, there is not reason we would see it.  Does the Shell send a copy back of what it receives?  No it does not.  Rather typically the UNIX kernel is configured, by default, to send back a copy of what it receives on a specific terminal connection back to the terminal itself.  This setting is called terminal ECHO mode.  So by default even before the Kernel sends data up to the destination program it sends a copy back to the terminal so that the user can see what they typed.  This includes the `\\n` that the user pressed to indicate the end of the command line.  Hence, in this default mode any data sent back from the shells behavior will appear on a new-line.  Programs can ask the kernel to disable this setting to have more control of what the users sees.  As a matter of fact like many things in Unix there is a command you can issue to have the kernel adjust the setting for you terminal connect including turning off the echo behavior (`stty -echo` to turn off and `stty echo` to turn back on).  Doing so lets you observe what is really being sent back in response to your command and not what the kernel automatically generated as echo data.  Note things might get confusing quickly if you turn echo off.   But Unix is all about understanding how things work and have the power to control them.  If you want to know more try `man stty` but be warned you will find that communications on a terminal is actually quite a bit more complex than it might seem -- there is a lot of history and skeletons buried here and the kernel is *cooking* the communications quite a bit ;-)"

The rules of this processing define what is called the [Shell Grammar](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html#SHELL_GRAMMAR).  The Shell Grammar and builtin commands form an entire programming language.  Programs written in this language are called Shell Scripts and are used extensively to automate all sorts of tasks.     Over the years one learns more and more subtle aspects and usage of the shell grammar.  While it is possible to use the shell without really knowing its underlying grammer having a working knowledge can really help in understanding why the shell behaves the way it does and its somewhat strange syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this chapter we will build up our working knowledge of how the shell processes command lines and its grammar.  Let's begin by breaking down command line processing into the following six steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. break up (split) the line into \"blank\" seperated words (computer scientists also call these tokens)\n",
    "2. perform expansions\n",
    "3. parse redirections\n",
    "4. execute simple commands\n",
    "5. optionally wait for command to complete\n",
    "6. print prompt and wait for new command line if in interactive mode\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Breaking down a \"Command line\" into Simple Commands and Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step the shell splits the command line up into a set of tokens that form a \"simple commands\".   Several simple commands can make up a single command line. The common boundary that separates tokens are \"blanks\".  Blanks are `space` and `tab` characters ([blanks](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bash.1.html#DEFINITIONS).   In the ASCII code, space characters are encoded with a byte value of `0x20` and a tab is encoded by `0x09`.  So a sequence of one more of these two characters will cause the shell to split what is before and after the sequence into to separate tokens.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the blank `space` and `tab` characters the following characters `|  & ; ( ) < > newline` will also indicate the speration of tokens.  Together, these characters are known as the shell \"metacharacters\".  In time we will learn about how these characters affect the commands to be executed. Some will let us combine simple commands in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first token of simple command is the name of the command to execute.  The following tokens in a set will be passed to the command as arguments.     To know where the arguments of a particular simple command ends the shell looks for one of the following \"control\" operators.  Notice that some of the metacharacters, `| & ; ( )` and `newline` itself both separate tokens and terminate the tokens of simple command.    Using the control characters allow us to chain independent simple commands together. "

Two spaces then separate `hello` from `goodbye`.  Then tghe sequence of space, tab, space separate `goodbye` from `me`.  A single space seperates `me` from `again`.  `again` is terminated as a token by the following space, tab and newline.
