    "# The Shell -- Progammable User Interface to the computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Given its history and programmer bent UNIX's primary interface -- or way of interacting with it to get things done is a program called the \"shell\".  In the following sections we will introduce various aspects of the shell, UNIX and fundamental ideas common to all modern operating systems.    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started -- The Terminal and this book\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with a UNIX computer you must establish, one way or another, a plain text (ASCII) interactive session. \n",
    "We will learn what ASCII is later... for the moment is away of entering and displaying the basic english characters, numeric digits, and standard punctuation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this you must start a \"Terminal\" session.  A \"Terminal\" is an ASCII application that is designed to accept characters from your keyboard and send them to a program and similarly characters sent from the remote program will be displayed by the terminal program for you to read.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows you can start a terminal by using the PowerShell program and on OSX you can use the Terminal Application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step, after starting a terminal emulator, is to connect it to a computer running UNIX. Today we typically use a program called `ssh` to establish this connection. Both Windows and OSX come with `ssh` that you can invoke from within the terminal.   `ssh` takes a hostname of the computer as an arugment and then uses network protocols to establish a terminal connection to the specified computer.   In response to establishing the connection the UNIX computer will prompt you to identify yourself with your username and password.  This is called logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uppon succesfully logging in the remote UNIX computer will start a shell programming running for you and from that point on anything you do or see in that terminal window is going to or coming from that remote computer.   So that terminal connection is actually a window into another computer!  You can start more windows to create more concurrent connections to the same or other remote computers.  Doing so can be very useful to improve your productivity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However to make life a little easier in this book we use features of Jupyter to both create terminal sessions and establish connections to a UNIX computer from within the pages of the book themselves.  This allows you to directly and immediately explore the things we discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do encourage you to poke around outside of this book using a terminal emulator and ssh to get a better feel for what is actually happening and so that you can have more control.  In the 'real world' (and in later classes) you will be expected to understand how to use your personal computers, tablets and even phones to establish terminal connections to other computers and know how to get work done on them."

    "### Command Line Anatomy\n",
    "\n",
    "Our interactions with the shell are \"line oriented\".\n",
    "That is to say that once we are connected to the shell it will be waiting for us to enter a command.\n",
    "To indicate this it will print a \"prompt\" at the beginning of a line.  Cannonically the prompt is often  (If you are intested you can lookup how to customize the prompt to something you prefer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands are a plain text \"key\" words that the shell will \"execute\" for us.\n",
    "To get the shell to do something we enter the command along with any arguments and modifies and then press \n",
    "enter or return key to terminate the line and submit it to the shell.  At this point the shell will analyize the line we entered and will execute the command it it can.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we like we can place multiple commands to execute one after the other on a line by seperating them with a semicolon.  `;`\n",
    "\n",
    "### BASH\n",
    "\n",
    "Now given the age of UNIX over the years many different versions of the shell have been developed. All of them have a few properties in common:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The built in commands of the shell form a crude and yet quite powerfull programming language.\n",
    "- If the command one issues is not recognized as a built in command of the shell the shell will look to see if a program of the same name as the command exists and if so will run it.  \n",
    "- The shell provides ways for combining programs together so that the output of one can be feed to another\n",
    "\n",
    "One shell that is commonly used today is called ['BASH']() and it will be the one we use in this book.  Like the other shells the basic syntax of BASH is quite simple but it can get pretty weird and subtle as you start using more advanced features.  The strangeness of the shell is part of what gives UNIX its reputation for being cryptic and yet powerful. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point is just to learn some basic syntax and a sense for what the shell can do.  Our main goal is to learn enough to be proficient and understand the core concepts of work in the UNIX environment.  Specifically, what the following are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- files  \n",
    " - directories\n",
    " - programs\n",
    " - processes\n",
    " \n",

For the moment this might seem like a silly command but later we will see that the shell is not just designed to be an interactive interface but also a powerful programming language that we can use to quickly automate things and construct our own commands out of the exiting ones."
