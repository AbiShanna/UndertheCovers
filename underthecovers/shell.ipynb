    "# UNIX  -- An operating System Built by Programmers for Programmers\n",
    "\n",
    "The UNIX operating system was built by master programmers who valued programmablity and productivity.  In some sense learning to work on the UNIX systems is a right of passage that not only teaches you how to be productive on a computer runnig the UNIX operating system but teaching you to think and act like a programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Shell -- Progammable Interface to the computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Given its history and programmer bent UNIX's primary interface -- or way of interacting with it to get things done is a program called the \"shell\".  In the following sections we will introduce various aspects of the shell, UNIX and fundamental ideas common to all modern operating systems.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started -- The Terminal and this book\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with a UNIX computer you must establish, one way or another, a plain text (ASCII) interactive session. \n",
    "We will learn what ASCII is later... for the moment is away of entering and displaying the basic english characters, numeric digits, and standard punctuation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this you must start a \"Terminal\" session.  A \"Terminal\" is an ASCII application that is designed to accept characters from your keyboard and send them to a program and similarly characters sent from the remote program will be displayed by the terminal program for you to read.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows you can start a terminal by using the PowerShell program and on OSX you can use the Terminal Application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step, after starting a terminal emulator, is to connect it to a computer running UNIX. Today we typically use a program called `ssh` to establish this connection. Both Windows and OSX come with `ssh` that you can invoke from within the terminal.   `ssh` takes a hostname of the computer as an arugment and then uses network protocols to establish a terminal connection to the specified computer.   In response to establishing the connection the UNIX computer will prompt you to identify yourself with your username and password.  This is called logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uppon succesfully logging in the remote UNIX computer will start a shell programming running for you and from that point on anything you do or see in that terminal window is going to or coming from that remote computer.   So that terminal connection is actually a window into another computer!  You can start more windows to create more concurrent connections to the same or other remote computers.  Doing so can be very useful to improve your productivity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However to make life a little easier in this book we use features of Jupyter to both create terminal sessions and establish connections to a UNIX computer from within the pages of the book themselves.  This allows you to directly and immediately explore the things we discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do encourage you to poke around outside of this book using a terminal emulator and ssh to get a better feel for what is actually happening and so that you can have more control.  In the 'real world' (and in later classes) you will be expected to understand how to use your personal computers, tablets and even phones to establish terminal connections to other computers and know how to get work done on them."
