In the 1970's CPUs were composed of thousands of transistors and only required tens of pins to connect to rest of the computer.  By 2021 we see that cpus now contain billions of transistors and require thousands for physical connections to the rest of the system.  We have, in fact, pushed the physical boundaries to the point that it is unclear exactly how we can make more powerful cpus that still preserve a simple programming model.

    "While an over-simplification, one of the uses of transistors in a CPU is to create, \"switches\" that form the logic circuits used to implement basic operations such as adding numbers. In order to make the CPU do these operations faster we need to be able to operate the transistors, turn them on and off, faster and faster.  Unfortunately doing so requires more and more energy and creates more more heat.  As such over the last decade it has become harder and harder to speed up CPUs, given the increase in energy and attendant increase in heat it leads too.   On the other hand we have managed to figure out how to continually shrink the size of transistors.  This has allowed us to pack more and more transistors into CPUs, however some believe that we are getting to end of this ability as we are approaching the physical limits to how small we can make a transistor.</p> \n",

    "Regardless we have reached a point that making cpus operate faster is very hard to do and while we might be able to fit more transistors on the chip we are reaching the limits of how many we have powered on at the same time (due to energy and heat constraints).  Finally it is also very hard to imagine that we can fit many more \"pins\" that connect the cpu to the rest of the computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years these effects have resulted in a situation that the performance of the software we write has become more and more dependent on how it interacts with the internal way the extra transistors are used.  For example in a modern processor a large number of transistors are used to form what is called [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache) memory.  While software can benefit, its performance increases, from caches it is possible to write the same software in different ways that get greater or lesser benefit if you understand how the caches work and the way your software interacts with them.  Similarly today CPU's often use the extra transistors to create multiple internal sub-CPUs, called [cores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor).  A program, however does not automatically benefit from multiple cores unless it is written to explicitly exploit them via \"parallel threads\" of execution.  But to understand how to do this one first needs to understand the classic model by which a single core CPU works and its interaction with memory.   \n",

By forming this distinction the tools we use can try and help us catch bugs in our program which lead it to accidentally attempting to execute values from areas of memory that contain data.

There are many reasons why we might have the value `36` in memory at various locations.  At some location we might be using it to encode the dollar sign character in <a href=\"../unix/terminal.ipynb#ASCII_sec\">ASCII</a> or maybe at some other location we are using the value `36` to represent the age of a player in our game or maybe is in the link field of a linked list node that tells us the address of the next node.   This is indicative of the more general challenge when to comes to programming a computer we must be very careful to not accidentally interpret a value at a location in a way that we did not intent for it to be.  Most of our higher level programming tools and languages work very hard to help us avoid this by forcing a very strict organization on how things are put in memory and adding checks to the code to make sure that the our program is not trying to interpret a memory location in a way we did not intended.  When programming in lower-level languages, like assembly and C, we have the power to direct the CPU to do anything it can.  However, it is then our job to take care to interpret all values correctly, by staying extremely organized and write careful code.  There is nothing that marks a particular address as containing a particular type of data item.  The only thing that determines what the value at a location \"means\" is code that uses it!  So you must organize memory and write code very carefully to avoid the computer from doing something you do not intend.  Remember that a modern computer can execute hundreds of billions of instructions per second so once things go off the rails, because of a miss-interpretation of a value, many instructions can be executed after and you may or may not ever know that an error occurred and where or why!"

    "\n",
    "Certain things happen in the decode phase: 1) Identify which operation is to be executed 2) determine where the inputs are coming from (getting them from memory if needed) and 3) setting up where the output will go.  The parts of the CPU that do the setup is often called the control plane/path of the CPU.  We are not particularly concerned with details of how this is implemented in the CPU what we care about is have a concrete knowledge of how an opcode is interpreted -- decoded. As such we artificially break it down into decoding down into three distinct steps for clarity."
