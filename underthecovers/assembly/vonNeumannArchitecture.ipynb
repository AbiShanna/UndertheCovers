These challenges and the current approach to trying to mitigate them also has an effect on how one needs to write software that will perform well on modern hardware.

Over the years it is clear that the complexity of CPUs has certainly grown.  In the 1970's CPUs were composed of thousands of transistors and only required tens of pins to connect to rest of the computer.  By 2021 we see that cpus now contain billions of transistors and require thousands for physical connections to the rest of the system.  We have, in fact, pushed the physical boundaries to the point that it is unclear exactly how we can make more powerful cpus that still preserve a simple programming model. The way software is written and structured becomes more and more important in order to get most out of a computer.

    "While an over-simplification, one of the uses of transistors in a CPU is to create, \"switches\" that form the logic circuits used to implement basic operations such as adding numbers. In order to make the CPU do these operations faster we need to be able to operate the transistors, turn them on and off, faster and faster.  Unfortunately doing so requires more and more energy and creates more more heat.  As such over the last decade it has become harder and harder to speed up CPUs, given the increase in energy and attendant increase in heat it leads too.   On the other hand we have managed to figure out how to continually shrink the size of transistors.  This has allowed us to pack more and more transistors into CPUs, however some believe that we are getting to end of this ability as we are approaching the physical limits to how small we can make a transistor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless we have reached a point that making cpus operate faster is very hard to do and while we might be able to fit more transistors on the chip we are reaching the limits of how many we have powered on at the same time (due to energy and heat constraints).  Finally it is also very hard to imagine that we can fit many more \"pins\" that connect the cpu to the rest of the computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years these effects have resulted in a situation that the performance of the software we write has become more and more dependent on how it interacts with the internal way the extra transistors are used.  For example in a modern processor a large number of transistors are used to form what is called [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache) memory.  While software can benefit, its performance increases, from caches it is possible to write the same software in different ways that get greater or lesser benefit if you understand how the caches work and the way your software interacts with them.  Similarly today CPU's often use the extra transistors to create multiple internal sub-CPUs, called [cores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor).  A program, however does not automatically benefit from multiple cores unless it is written to explicitly exploit them via \"parallel threads\" of execution.  But to understand how to do this one first needs to understand the classic model by which a single core CPU works and its interaction with memory.   \n",

Many CPUs expand on this idea to provide multiple levels of privileged which enables a further degree of layering of the systems software.

There are many reasons why we might have the value 36 in memory at various locations.  At some location we might be using it to encode the dollar sign character in <a href=\"../unix/terminal.ipynb#ASCII_sec\">ASCII</a> or maybe at some other location we are using the value 36 to represent the age of a player in our game or maybe it is in the link field of a linked list node indicating that the memory address of the next node is 36.  In all these instances we would not want to try and interpret those areas of memory as instructions by executing them.\n",

When it comes to programming a computer we must be very careful to not accidentally interpret a value at a location in a way that we did not intent for it to be.  Most of our higher level programming tools and languages work very hard to help us avoid this by forcing a very strict organization on where things are put in memory and add checks to the code to make sure that the our program is not trying to interpret a memory location in a way was not intended.  When programming in lower-level languages, like assembly and C, we have the power to direct the CPU to do anything it can.  However, it is then our job to take care to interpret all values correctly, by staying extremely organized and writing careful code.  \n",

So you must organize memory and write code very carefully to avoid the computer from doing something you do not intend.  Remember that a modern computer can execute hundreds of billions of instructions per second so once things go off the rails, because of a miss-interpretation of a value, many instructions can be executed after and you may or may not ever know that an error occurred and where or why!\n",

    "\n",
    "As we read early, before we can use the CPU execution loop it is necessary to initialize the CPU's PC register to the address of where we have loaded our program instructions. While this is usually handled by the OS when we start programs via the OS.  But in order to facilitate getting the CPU executing code correctly when we are not using an OS (as is the case for SOL6502) the CPU provides a special reset procedure.  Usually when you power on the processor it enters this reset procedure.  Devices also often provide a physical button that can also put the CPU back into its reset procedure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each CPU varies in what the reset procedure does.  The documentation for the CPU will tell the programmer what register will be initialized to particular values and what registers will not be (those that are not will have random values and it will be the initial software's job to set these registers to known values).  One of the critical jobs of the reset procedure is to have set the PC to a particular value.  On some systems the value is a fixed address in memory on other systems the CPU will read the initial value for the PC from a fixed location in memory.  In either case it is the system designer who must arrange to have the values in memory so that the starting software will correctly begin executing after the reset procedure.  We will get to see how this works on the 6502 when we use SOL6502.\n",

Unlike RAM devices these are not volatile meaning that they maintain their values even when the computer is off.  As such they are usually attached to the memory bus so that reset sequence will set the PC to an address that points to startup code placed in these devices.  This code is often called **firmware**.  This code is software but because it is always present it is a little like the hardware.  The firmware is responsible for taking over  after the CPU reset procedure.  It initializes the CPU and the rest of the hardware (including  testing memory devices to make sure everything is working).  After that the firmware is responsible for locating, loading and starting the operating system kernel which will take over from their and allow application programs to run.\n",

    "<img src=\"../images/VNA-clock.png\" width=\"50%\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:auto 1em auto auto;\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "While as programmers it is generally hidden from us it is worth known that the inner workings of the CPU execution loop is driven by an electrical oscillator called the CPU **clock**.  This clock produces a continuous and pulse of high and low voltages. One **cycle** of the clock is the time it takes the clock to transit from a starting value, lets say low, go to high and then return back to low.  This signal is what drives the inner workings of the CPU execution loop. The faster the frequency the faster the the loop operates and the faster instructions of our program complete.   Different CPU's will be able to operate at different maximum clock frequencies.  Regardless though one cycle of the CPU's clock can act as a reference unit for use to measure how fast our instructions are executing -- Cycles per Instruction (CPI)  \n",
    "\n",
    "On a modern CPU different instructions, and for that matter sequence of instructions can require more or less cycles to complete.  Many of the complexities added over the years are to try and improve the average number of cycles it takes for the instructions of a program to execute.  Knowing how these features work allow you to write your programs in ways that minimize the number of cycles it takes.  In this section we will provide some insight into these but not go into any details.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### CPU caches\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that should jump out at us is the amount of communication that is required between the CPU and memory to get work done.  As we made CPU's faster and faster the speed of the memory bus and the memory devices became the limiting factor in how long it took to execute instructions.  The processors were spending more and more cycles \"stalled\" waiting for values to be received or sent from and to memory.  To alleviate this disparity CPU designers added \"cache\" memories inside the CPUs and dramatically expanded the data bus.  Programmers do not directly manage the caches, the CPU uses them internally to try and automatically improve performance.   Rather than reading or writing single values at a time when accessing memory CPUs now transfer larger blocks of several near by memory values at a time staging these block in the caches.  The caches close to the registers and can feed value to them very quickly.  CPUs have particular caching algorithms built into them to manage the caches and data within them.   The idea is that accessing a value at a particular address implies that the code will likely access the other nearby values as well.  If this turns out to be true then those values will be in the cache and no memory bus transactions will be required. If it is not true then memory transactions, that will slow down execution, will occur.  There are many details that we are skipping for the moment but it should be apparent that how you write your code and organize your data in memory can dramatically impact the effectiveness of the caches to hide the time to do memory bus transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pipe-lining and beyond\n",
    "\n",
    "In our simple model we broke the execution loop down into three distinct stages; 1) fetch, 2) decode and 3) execute.  Assuming that internally to the CPU there are physical components that implement these stages then one can observe that once the decode phase has started the fetch components are inactive and similarly while in the execute phase both the fetch and decode components would be inactive.  Lets assume for the moment that in the best case each stage takes a single cycle.  This means that each instruction will take at least three cycles and at best an instruction will complete every three cycles.  However, if we could identify cases in which we could start the next instruction so early so that it could use the prior inactive stages then while each individual instruction will still take three cycles will in the best case would be completing an instruction every cycle!\n",
    "    \n",
    "CPU designers exploited the observation and introduced the \"pipe lining\".  Internally the way CPUs implement execution was carefully decomposed into several stage each corresponding to separate functional units.  The CPU has various mechanism to allow multiple instructions to be come active in the stages as prior instructions have finished using them.  This is actually quite a tricky and some sequences of instruction and data accesses will inherently cause \"stalls\" in the pipeline.  Again while we have left out many details we again can intuitively observe that how the software is written can positively or negatively interact with pipe-lining.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Pipe lined execution spurred many more advanced CPU execution techniques including the addition of; [out-of-order execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution),  [super-scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscalar_processor), [hyper-threading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading), [branch prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor) and [speculative execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution).  This list is by no-means exhaustive CPU designers and researcher continue every year to explore new  techniques to try and reduce the number of cycles required to execute instructions.  We are now at the point that the many interacting techniques, several of which rely on statistical mechanisms, all interact with the code and data in subtle ways. \n",

    "The extensions discussed so far all try and improve performance without the explicit need to fundamentally re-design the software.  Multi-cores are different in this respect at least with regards to a single program.  A multi-core CPU is decomposed into several sub-cpus, cores.  Each core has its own registers and private caches and implement and independent execution loop.  As such multi-cores provide a programmer with the ability to explicitly structure their code into multiple \"threads\" of execution.  Where each thread can execute in parallel on a core and concurrently get work done while all have access to the main memory.  The level of true parallelism, the number of threads executing instruction at exactly the same time, will be limited by the number of cores in the system.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "Parallelism can be very powerful but also has many pitfalls associated with it.  To truly make use of it you typically need to re-think your software from the ground up and deal with various subtleties of how the cores interact with each other and memory.  To understand these interaction one must first get a solid grasp on how a single core works -- which is our fundamental goal. \n",

    "As we face many challenges to improving the performance of von Neumann based computers researches across many fields are pushing the envelop look for new ways to increase the power of computers.  This includes looking at designs that are no-longer consistent with the von Neumann model such as the following.\n",

    "While we have covered how a CPU and memory can operate together to implement program execution  we have no way to transfer values in or out of the computer.  The I/O subsystems of a computer are precisely to enable this ability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally I/O devices are called peripherals.  The goal is to allow software executing on the CPU to communicate with a wide range of devices ranging from terminals, keyboards, touch screens, wired and wireless networks, solid state drives, speakers, etc.  To facilitate this the hardware manufactures have created standardized I/O Buses that various peripheral devices can be built to connect too.  An example I/O Bus standard is [PCIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer designers typically bridge the I/O devices such that software running on the CPU can have two paths to communicating with them: 1) Memory Mapped I/O Path, and 2) CPU I/O Path\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Mapped I/O Path**: In this approach  a range of the memory bus addresses are mapped to the I/O Bus. CPU memory bus transactions to this range are translated into transactions on the I/O buses.   In this way the CPU can communicate values to particular I/O peripherals by simply reading and writing to the correct addresses. It is important to remember that while from a software perspective memory mapped I/O seems like communicating with memory devices reads and writes to the I/O peripherals are much slower given the extra circuitry and the slower nature of the devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CPU I/O Path**: Some CPU's have instructions and support for transferring data on an I/O bus and thus to particular peripherals. In this case software must be written to specifically use the correct I/O instructions to communicate with peripherals.  Again it is important to remember that despite having these connections communicating with peripherals is indirect and slower that communicating with memory devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern computers  primarily rely on memory mapped I/O for the majority of I/O communications.  Regardless, in general, the only software that directly controls and communicates with I/O devices are in the OS Kernel.  These OS components are called [devices drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver).  As such application software running on an OS makes calls to the OS to conduct I/O and need not worry about the details of how to control and communicate with I/O devices which can be quite complex and device specific.   \n",
    "\n",
    "If we do need to conceptualize I/O operation we will assume Memory Mapped I/O.  The main thing to note about I/O is that it is really just another destination for the CPU to send and receive values to and from.  Peripherals are designed to receive and interpret values in device specific ways.  For example writing the correct value to an ASCII terminal device will cause it to display the appropriate character while writing other values will move the cursor to a different location.  Similarly a [USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB) microphone will produce a stream of values that represent audio frequency samples and reading and storing them in memory lets us process audio. "
