    "## Files\n",
    "<img align=\"right\" src=\"../images/file.pdf\">In UNIX a file is an abstract object that can store information.  In particular we can write contents too and read contents from it. Beyond the information it contains a file has associated with it several other descriptive facts.  Examples of these facts include:\n",
    " - who owns the file \n",
    " - the length of the file (measured in [bytes](../assembly/byte))\n",
    " - who has permissions to read or write its contents \n",
    " - the time the contents was last modified\n",
    " - the time that it was last read\n",
    " - the time that the descriptive facts where last changed (eg the file permissions were modified)\n",
    "\n",
    "We think of the contents of the file as the \"data\" of the file and we think of other information as the \"meta-data\" of the file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing to note is that at this point we are not distiguishing the type of information that the data of a file contains -- rather files just contain a collection of [bytes](../assembly/byte).  The bytes of the file might encode [ascii](terminal) data, image data, audio data, an executable program, etc.  As we will see later it will be up to us to decide how we want to treat the contents of a file by what we do with it (eg open it in a text editor versus opening it in a music player).

    "> Why do say that a file is an \"abstract\" object?  Well when it comes to computers most of the things we think of as \"real\" are just constructions of software.  An operating system like UNIX is responsible for providing us with things like files but in reality there is rarely a single physical object that corresponds to any given file.  Rather it is the job of the operating system to use the resources of the computer to create an abstract file object if we ask it to do so and ensure that it behaves as expected. "
