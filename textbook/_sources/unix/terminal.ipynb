    "For a human to work with the computer we had to attach a device that could both display output from from the software running on the computer and accept input.

Eg if the software running on the computer sent the number 65 to the terminal the terminal would display capital 'A' at the current [\"cursor\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(user_interface)) position.  The terminal would also advance the cursor to the right so that the next encoded character sent would appear to the right of the last.  \n",

    "In addition the the screen terminals had a keyboad.  These were built so that when a key was pressed on the keyboard the terminal would send the corresponding ASCII value to the computer.  Each key being labeled with the ASCII symbol of the value that pressing it would send.   This way software running on the computer could take text input from the user in addition to displaying it.   Furthmore it was easy to have the software  break the input into \"words\" and \"lines\" by having it scann the ASCII values sent for Spaces and LineFeeds. Which were sent when the spacebar and return (or enter) key where pressed.  \n",

    "While the computers and terminals that we discussed above are relics of the past.   UNIX and its development environment is still alive and thriving.  It turns out that the simplicilty of an ASCII terminal and the ASCII oriented programming tools of UNIX continue to power much of the digital world around us.  [LINUX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and other versions of UNIX runs on every imaginable device today all the way from supercomputers to watches. And at some point or another a programmer used terminal sessions communicating with the UNIX running on those devices to develop and debug the layers of software that most people never see but rely on to make those devices useful.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">As we learn more about how software is constructed and how computers work we will learn that the power of UNIX comes from making it very natural and easy for programmers to construct programs that can themselves be used to process and translate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we use \"software\" versions of terminals to allow us to create connections to an operating system either running on the physcial machine we are on or to other remote computers. Apple's MacOSX, is a UNIX derived operating systems and includes a program called [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)).    Microsoft's Windows OS is not a UNIX operating systems but includes a similar program called [Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/).  Unlike the old days since there is really no physical terminal device a single user can start as many terminal sessions each within its own window as one likes.  As we will see later it is very useful to use multiple terminal sessions to organize your work.  Addionally both OSX and Windows provides a program called [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell_Protocol).   SSH allows you to use a terminal app running on your computer to connect to remote computers.  Doing so is like connecting a terminal device to the remote computers you are connect to.  Here is s link to using ssh on windows [Windows Terminal SSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/tutorials/ssh) and link to using ssh on OS [OSX Terminal SSH](https://osxdaily.com/2017/04/28/howto-ssh-client-mac/).  \n",

    "As a matter of fact if you are reading this book, in interactive mode, there is a LINUX computer that is running a program to serve the book's content to your webbrowser.  This software, \"JupyterLab\", not only allows you to read and interact with the books pages but it also allows you to create terminal sessions so that you can directly use the UNIX development tools of the computer via the traditional ASCII interface all within your webbrowser.  To do so use the File->New->Terminal menu item.  This will create a new Terminal session as a JuypterLab tab.  You can start as many as you like and you can drag them to organize them as you like as well.  Much of this book assumes that you will do this while you are reading the book so that you can explore and try things out.\n",
